# KerbalScripts

Repository with a small compilation of scripts that I made in python for the mod [kRPC](https://spacedock.info/mod/69/kRPC) for Kerbal Space Program

### Prerequisites

Make sure to have python 3 installed in your computer, if not you can download it from [here](https://www.python.org). Since pip comes by default in python 3 there is no need to install it.

If you are using any Linux distro with apt package management just type the following in the terminal.

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3.6
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
```

To install the needed libraries use the following commands, they work for Windows and Linux. For windows users, you have to use the CMD terminal to install them.

```
pip3 install krpc
```
